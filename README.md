Machine Learning
This project was performed in R. It is likely my most extensive project, and pulls from many different csv files, most of
which originated from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikoajfish99/us-recession-and-financial-indicators?select=Unemployment+Level.csv
This project was the largest learning curve in my entire education. The class encouraged a "throw the kitchen sink at it" approach,
which led to many new techniques being learned and implemented. Some of those include: clustering, KNN, operating with very unclean data,
aprio rule mining, decision trees, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and varIMP (from random forest). This was a very extensive project
and worth checking out to see a good example of what I'm capable of.
